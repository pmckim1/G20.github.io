													<h2>Military Total Spending 2013-2017</h2>
												</header>
												<div id ="MilitaryspendingG20_div"></div>
												<p>This column chart shows that in overall dollars spent, the US far out paces the rest of the countries in military spending. </p>
											</article>
											<article>
												<header>
													<h2>Healthcare Total Spending 2013-2017</h2>
												</header>
												<div id ="HealthG20_div"></div>
												<p>Similar to the previous chart, the US also spends a lot more on healthcare than the other countries for all the years included in this analysis.</p>
											</article>
											<article>
												<header>
													<h2>Education Total Spending 2013-2017</h2>
												</header>
												<div id ="educspendingG20_div"></div> 
												<p>The available data for education is not as complete as the information for healthcare and military spending. However, from the available information, the US ranks first in spending 
												for the years we can see.</p>
											</article>
											<article>
												<header>
													<h2>Total GDP 2013-2017</h2>
												</header>
												<div id ="gpdcurrent"></div> 
												<p>Next looking at the GDP, we see that the US is the clear leader. However, not by as wide a margin as for the categories of military, healthcare, and education spending. </p>
											</article>
 											<header class="major">
                                        	<h2>Average Per Capita Spending Analysis</h2>
                                        	<p>The charts below depict overall per capita GDP of the G20 and per capita spending on military, healthcare, and education. These numbers show the averages for these categories taken from 2013-2017.  
											It is important to note that education numbers are incomplete so they cannot be used for as meaningful an analysis compared to the spending in the other categories.</p>
                                    		</header>

													<h2>Population vs Per Average Capita GDP </h2>
												</header>
												<div id ="pop_div1"></div> 
												<p>This bubble chart shows that countries with very high populations tend to have lower GDP per Capita for countries in the G20.</p>
											</article>
											<article>
												<header>
													<h2>Average Per Capita Spending and GDP</h2>
												</header>
												<div id ="percapitaavgcolumn"></div> 
												<p>While, the US still stays close to the top when viewing the same metrics through the lens of per capita spending and GDP, it does not outpace the other countries in the G20 nearly as much 
												as it did in the prior graphs.  Here, Australia has a higher average GDP per capita. While US military and healthcare spending is higher, it is not by nearly as wide a margain as was seen in raw dollars.</p>
											</article>
											<article>
												<header>
													<h2>Average Per Capita Spending including Education</h2>
												</header>
												<div id ="percapitaavgspend"></div> 
												<p>For most countries, healthcare is a far bigger expense than military or education (for the countries that had education information avaliable). The only country that bucked this trend was Saudi Arabia,
												which spent more on military per capita than they did on healthcare. Saudi Arabia also had the highest per capita spending on the military of any country. For education, countries that have avaliable information (figures taken by averaging together avaliable data) mostly spend more on education than military, except for Russia where the opposite is true.
												Again, the US appears to have spent the most behind Australia, but this analysis suffers from a lack of avaliable information so, comparisons are made cautiosuly.</p>
											</article>
											<article>
												<header>
													<h2>Military vs Healthcare Per Capita Spending</h2>
												</header>
												 <div id="bubble_div1"></div>
												<p>There appears to be a positive correlation between military and healthcare spending, except for Saudi Arabia which, as previously mentioned, spends a lot on military per capita, but not very much on healthcare</p>
											</article>
											<article>
												<header>
														<h2>Military vs Healthcare vs Education vs GDP Per Capita Spending</h2>
												</header>
												<div id="bubble_div"></div>
												<p>Factoring in the average per capita education spending (represented by size) and GDP per capita (represented by color), we see that increases in spending in both of these categories could possibly, be attributed to these countries also having higher GDP’s per capita. Again,
												 Saudi Arabia is an outlier. Its GDP is middle of the pack but its military spending is very large. Viewing the data through this lense also shows that for countries where information is avaliable, countries with higher per capita GDPs tend to spend higher amounts of money on education 
												than lower GDP per capita countries. </p>

                                        	<h2>Percent of GDP Change in Spending Over Time Analysis</h2>
                                        	<p>The charts line graphs below track the change in percent of GDP spent in the time period in the categories of military, healthcare, and education spending.</p>
                                    		</header>

													<h2>Military Percent of GDP 2013-2017</h2>
												</header>
												<div id="mil_per_gpd_div"></div>
												<p>Military spending in terms of percent of GDP for most of the countries stays fairly flat and is mostly under 3% . The top spenders through this metric were Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the US. Saudi Arabia is 
												well above the others while Russia still stays under 6% overall. Interestingly, the US military spending decreased during this time frame, while Saudi Arabia and Russia both saw spikes, respectively. Saudi Arabia appears to currently be on an upward trend 
												after coming down from a spike towards the end of this time period while Russia's spending appears to be decreasing.</p>
											</article>
											<article>
												<header>
													<h2>Healthcare Percent of GDP 2013-2017</h2>
												</header>
												<div id="HC_per_gpd_div"></div>
												<p>Healthcare Spending in terms of percent of GDP shows a lot more variation in amount spent than military spending. The US is the top spender with between 16%-17% spent each year. India spent the least 
												at just under 3% per year. None of the countries showed dramatic increases in healthcare. Argentina showed the most flutuation.     </p>
											</article>
											<article>
												<header>
													<h2>Education Percent GDP 2013-2017</h2>
												</header>
												<div id="educ_per_gpd_div"></div>
												<p>This visualization of education percent GDP mostly shows the lack information avaliable on this category. South Africa and Argentina had the most complete information and both were among the top spenders 
												in the recorded information. India had the lowest percent of GDP education spending but did not have statistics avaliable for 2016 or 2017.    </p>

                                        	<h2>Interesting Findings and Trends Analysis</h2>
                                        	<!--<p>The charts below show particularly interesting trends seen in the data.</p>-->
                                    		</header>

													<h2>Change in Overall Military Spending Per Capita</h2>
												</header>
												<div id ="milchangegeo_pc_div"></div> 
												<p>This geomap shows the change in per capita military spending. The UK had the biggest decrease, along with the US and Saudi Arabia. This is surpising since Saudi Arabia consistently displayed 
												higher rates of military spending. Surprisingly, Mexico, Canada and Australia had the biggest increases, followed by China. Overall, most of the countries are blue which indicates an increase in spending.  </p>
											</article>
											<article>
												<header>
													<h2>Change in Overall Healthcare Spending per Capita</h2>
												</header>
												<div id ="healthchangegeo_pc_div"></div> 
												<p>This geomap depicting change in healthcare spending shows that spending per capita decreased in most of the G20. Unlike the military chart, most of the countries are orange or brown which indicates a 
												decrease in spending. In many instances, it appears almost as a reverse mirror image of the military geomap depicting change. The US had the biggest increase, followed by Mexico. 
												Interestingly, Canada, Australia, and France had the largest per capita decrease.</p>
											</article>
											<article>
												<header>
													<h2>Change in Overall Education Spending per Capita</h2>
												</header>
												<div id ="educchangegeo_pc_div"></div> 
												<p>This geomap depicting change in education spending was made using change in per capita spending for the latest and earliest years for which data was avaliable. Countries in green did not have any information. 
												Unlike the healthcare chart, most of the countries are blue which indicates a increase in spending. Australia and the Uk had the biggest increases in per capita spending; while Japan and Italy 
												were the countries to experience the biggest reduction in spending.   
												</p>
											</article>
											<article>

													<h2>Change in Per Capita Spending Across Categories</h2>
												</header>
												<p> This combined view bubble chart confirms what was seen in the geomaps. There are no clear trends in each category for changes to per capita across countries. Countries increase spending in some areas while decreasing in others.     </p>
												 <div id ="bubble2_div"></div> 
											</article>
											<article>
												<header>
													<h2>Change in Overall Spending Across Categories in Total Spend  </h2>
												</header>
												<div id="both_change_gpd_div"></div>
												<p>This chart shows overall change in raw dollars spent on Military and Healthcare. For the most part, these numbers appear very small overall. The only clearly identifiable metrics are China and the US both increased their healthcare and China also 
												increased their military spending the most. Conversely, the US had the biggest decrease in military spending.  </p>
											</article>
											<article>
												<header>
													<h2>Change in Percent of GDP across Categories </h2>
												</header>
												 <div id="bothper_change_gpd_div"></div>
												<p>However, similar to our previous analysis, viewing the same information using the metric of percent change of GDP spending provides a different view. Here, suprisingly we see that Canada had the biggest increase in Military spending of 30% which at first seems like a lot.
												However, showing this big of an increase is made easier by Canada's very low military spending rate overall. This also confirms our finding based on per capita change in military spending. Meanwhile, Brazil had the biggest increase in healthcare. While the overall dollars spent showed the US as way out front for increases in healthcare spending, 
												in terms of percent change GDP, the US is not even in the top 8. Again, this is due to the relatively small percentages being spent initially by the countries at the top of the list.   
												The biggest decrease in military spending was seen in the US and Russia.   </p>
											</article>

													<h2>Future Trends</h2>
												</header>
												<p> Based on the findings in the average per capita seciton of this analysis, I expected education, military, and healthcare spending to rise along with GDP, given that countries with a higher GDP seem to also spend more on education, military, and healthcare.  However, looking at changes in per capita spending, the trend is not as clear cut.
												 Although some countries have increased spending in healthcare and education, military spending increased more than these other two categories. Percent of GDP metrics also confirms that military spending is on the rise more so than either healthcare or education spending. 
												 In the future, as GDP likely continues to rise as economies around the world continue to develop, hopefully education spending and healthcare spending will rise along with military in perent of GDP spent.   </p>

                                    		</header>
											<p>This analysis was created for DATS 6401 – Visualization of Complex Data with Prof. Zahadat. I used three sources: 1. World Bank Database 2.SIPRI Military Expenditure Database 3. UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) Database on Education. 
											As mentioned previosuly, Education information was not readily avaliable, making that portion of the overall analyis not as robust as other findings. The Webpage interface was made by adapting the "Massively" template avaliable under creative 
											commons from HTML5Up.  Data preprocessing was done using python and excel. Visualizations were made using Googlesheets and Googlecharts and coded using Javascript. </p>
